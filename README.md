What I Am Most Proud of in the Assignment-
I am most proud of the animations i created for the flowers blooming. They are both hand drawn by me and then edited in photoshop. I think these animations make the game more interesting and fun to play. I am proud that i got them working and in the game as i have never done something like that before. 
I am very happy with the particle effects, sound effects and world environment i created. I think the particle and sound effects make the game engaging and fun to play. The sound effects i got off online sources, but for the butterfly i created my own by recording audio. The world environment was tricky to work out, but once i added the bloom to my level it looked brighter. 

What I Learned-
How to instantiate other scenes into my main scene. I am so used to using prefabs in unity that it was hard to learn. Everything in my game was created in its own scene and then called when needed. By the end of the project i was very used to calling and preloading scenes. 
I also learned alot about variables and how to use them between scripts. Using export variables is similar to public variables in unity. 
These two skills were extremeluy important to the creation of this game. 
I also feel like i have a better understanding of if statements. 
I learned how to use the particle systems in godot, i struggled at first to get them working, but once i did it was pretty straight forward. 


Mechanics-
You use the arrow keys to move the hose around. The movement is unique as it isnt just left and right movement, the player can also move un and down the screen aswell. This is different to normal spaceshooter type games as i wanted the player to be able to get closer to the flowers and have them grow where they want. 

There is a score and a flower counter letting the players know how many points theyve got and how many flowers theyve grown, but on the end screen these are not mentioned. The only text is 'this garden is beautiful, well done!' this is because the game is about growing pretty flowers, not score. The player should play for the flowers and not the points, like other violent shooters. 

Enemies- 
The 'enemies' are two different kinds of flower buds, lilys and carnations, when hit, they spawn in an animation of the flower blooming. This animation was hand drawn by me. 
The enemies movement is created using tweens. The lily buds move left and right across the screen, where as the carnations also move up and down to make them more difficult to catch. 
The lilys are worth 1 point and the carnations are worth 2.

The butterflys, which the player should not shoot, fly across the screen at the start of each level. When hit the butterflys play an animation and then despawn. If hit they take 5 points away from the player.
