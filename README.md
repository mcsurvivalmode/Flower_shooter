What I Am Most Proud of in the Assignment-
I am most proud of the animations i created for the flowers blooming. They are both hand drawn by me and then edited in photoshop. I think these animations make the game more interesting and fun to play. I am proud that i got them working and in the game as i have never done something like that before. 
I am very happy with the particle effects, sound effects and world environment i created. I think the particle and sound effects make the game engaging and fun to play. The sound effects i got off online sources, but for the butterfly i created my own by recording audio. The world environment was tricky to work out, but once i added the bloom to my level it looked brighter. 

What I Learned-
How to instantiate other scenes into my main scene. I am so used to using prefabs in unity that it was hard to learn. Everything in my game was created in its own scene and then called when needed. By the end of the project i was very used to calling and preloading scenes. 
I also learned alot about variables and how to use them between scripts. Using export variables is similar to public variables in unity. 
These two skills were extremeluy important to the creation of this game. 
I also feel like i have a better understanding of if statements. 
I learned how to use the particle systems in godot, i struggled at first to get them working, but once i did it was pretty straight forward.
